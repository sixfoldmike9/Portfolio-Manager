This project is a web application built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web apps. 
The app provides features for stock prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models and Prophet forecasting, along with portfolio optimization using Markowitz Portfolio Theory. 
It allows users to input stock symbols, visualize historical stock data, predict future stock prices, and optimize their investment portfolios based on risk and return. 
The app also includes web scraping functionality to fetch real-time stock data and offers a user-friendly interface for exploring and analyzing financial markets.
